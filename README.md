### 🕵️‍♀️ What you'll find

- neovim `init.vim` file
- tmux `tmux.conf` file
- config file for git `.gitconfig`

### 👩‍🍳 What you'll need

I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for its plugins.
Init file should be at `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`.

Also, [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for plugins.

Use at your own responsibility 🙅
