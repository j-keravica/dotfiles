### 🕵️‍♀️ What You'll Find

- neovim `init.vim` file
- tmux `tmux.conf` file
- config file for git `.gitconfig`

### 👩‍🍳 What You'll Need

I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for its plugins.
Init file should be at `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`. It's mostly set up to work with TypeScript.

You also need to install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for neovim language service tools to work.

Also, [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for plugins.
